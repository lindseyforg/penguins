## Relationship between multiple traits ##

Here is a plot looking at the relationship between bill length and bill depth. We can see that bill length tends to correlate positively with bill depth for all species, and Adelie penguins have the shortest and deepest bills, and Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins have similar length bills but Chinstrap penguins have deeper bills than Gentoo penguins. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))
```
