## Sexual dimorphism ##

Here are some plots looking at sexual dimorphism in penguins. We can see that the distribution of males is generally larger than that of females for all 3 species. 

```{r}
filter(penguins, !is.na(sex)) %>%
ggplot() +  
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, color = sex))
```

Separating based on species, we can see sexual dimorphism exhibited in all 3 species based on body mass. 

```{r}
filter(penguins, !is.na(sex)) %>%
ggplot() + 
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~ species)
```
