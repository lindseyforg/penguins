## Single trait distribution ##

Here is a plot looking at the bill length distribution of the Palmer penguins. We can see that Adelie penguins have a smaller bill length than Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins, which exhibit more overlap. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, color = species,  fill = species), alpha = 0.3)
```
